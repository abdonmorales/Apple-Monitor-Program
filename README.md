# Apple ][ Memory Monitor Program v3.1
Apple Program/Monitor is a memory/hardware Monitor Program created by me in 2019 and is now open-source for those who want to create a spinoff --> This only works on the Apple II Series (except the IIgs)
The program is written in IntBASIC/IntBASIC Pro/ Applesoft BASIC
